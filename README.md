# notebooks-tests

## Intro
In order to manage automatic tests for students exercises, we will mange the code here.

Each of the automatic tests will assume that we have a method as explained in the exercise.

* The text of the class will be matched to the subject name
* The text of the test method will be matched to the function name the student will be see
* The assertion errors texts will be show to the user as well

## Writing tests
* create a pytest class and write some tests
* create a PR to the master branch with the code. verify that you are setting the right subject for the class
* After the branch merged to master, we will upgrade the server with the test code.
